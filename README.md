### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Welcome to TIMES-Europe

We introduce a novel energy system model that is being developed at the Energy Transition Studies (ETS) department of the Dutch Institute for Applied Scientific Research (TNO). 
TIMES-Europe is a multisectoral, technology-rich model built upon the TIMES generator. This new model covers the European Union and its direct neighboring countries.
